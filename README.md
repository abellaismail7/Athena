# Athena
Athena is comming to our school ( **1337KH** ) with blessing of god.

<img src="./assets/school_of_athen.jpg">

&nbsp;

# About the project
This project is intended to start a library in 1337Kh sponsored
by students and former students or anyone who believe in our skills
and our potential.

&nbsp;

# Why?
42 network have one of the most effective cursus in the world.
the people behind it are smart people and know what they are doing.
while the cursus can teach you about some important technical areas in computer science,
I am sure that it's not enough and 42 knows that. we should learn by ourselves.

With that in mind we think that we need a library where we can discover new things,
learn more and boost our skills making 1337 proud of their students.

The companies will be glad to see a 1.5 year student with too much knowlege about software
architecture and design patterns ...
those skills that a 1337 student would normally learn in the internship.

&nbsp;

# What books
There are some highly recommanded books in computer science that are going to be prioritized over other things.

&nbsp;

## **- Design and architecture**
Data structures and algorithms are necessary to write understandable and maintainable code.

| Book | Description |
| ---- | ----------- |
| **Clean Code** | most popular book among developers and will help us improve readability and testability of your code, which makes a good programmer a good programmer. |
| **Pragmatic Programmer** | time is money, this book will help you do your job in the most pragmatic way saving time (it's good for beginners). |
| **Code Complete: a Practical Handbook of Software Construction** | a nice addition to The Pragmatic Programmer, gives you the necessary framework to talk about code. |
| **Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software** | this is an introduction to follow patterns that all programmers are familiar with. |
| **Refactoring** | your code isn't perfect ? let's make it better and better. |

## **- Algo and Data Structure**
Algo&DS is so important skills to get some balls to take an interview with FAANG

| Book | Description |
| ---- | ----------- |
| **Introduction to Algorithms**  | uniquely combines rigor and comprehensiveness, the book covers a broad range of algorithms in depth. |
| **A common sense guide to data structures and algorithms** | a beginner friendly book for algorithms and data structures |
| **The Algorithm Design Manual** | let's take some 1337kh to FAANG. |

## **- Kernel**
And because the kernel is a critical component and even the smallest flaws on this component can take whole infrastructures down, learning the kernel is a must.
We need some students to crack the universe and have no life Maher recommanded those books:

| Book | Description |
| ---- | ----------- |
| **Understanding the linux kernel** | Learn the internals of the greatest kernel ever written on this fucking planet.|
| **Linux Device Driver** | Learn the module subsystem and driver development.|
| **Linux Kernel development** | Learn how to help developping the kernel maybe introduce a new subsystem.|
| **A Guide to Kernel Exploitation: Attacking the Core**| Learn common kernel programmers mistakes and avoid them in your own code. (This book covers the most known UNIX derivatives, Mac OS XNU kernel, Windows NT too).

## **- Languages**
We learn languages from videos and it's wrong learn from source:

| Book | Description |
| ---- | ----------- |
| **The C programming language**   | |
| **Effective C++**                | |
| **Zero To Production In Rust**   | 🦀 |
| **Rust for rustaceans**          | 🦀 |
| **Writing An Interpreter In Go** | |
| **Eloquent javascript**          | 🤑 |
| **You don't know Js**            | |
| **Fluent Python**                | |

> This List is expandable !( JS is welcomed ^_^ )

## **- AI and Data Science**
let's explore the skill of the century !!

| Book | Description |
| ---- | ----------- |
| **The Machine Learning Simplified: A Gentle Introduction to Supervised Learning** | (beginner) simple intuitive examples to explain complex concepts, algorithms or methods, as well as democratize all math behind the scenes |
| **Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras, and TensorFlow**  | (Intermidiate) Its goal is to give you the concepts, tools, and intuition you need to implement programs capable of learning from data |
| **Designing Machine Learning Systems** | (advanced) This book is for anyone who wants to leverage ML to solve real-world problems |

***
&nbsp;

## **- Security**
The biggest issue you'll face in security, and in life, is your own stupidity.

| Book | Description |
| ---- | ----------- |
| **Android Security Internals**  | An In-Depth Guide to Android's Security Architecture
| **Android Hacker's Handbook**  | Discovering and preventing attacks on the Android OS
| **The Art of macOS malware** | A comprehensive handbook to macOS internals and cracking open these malicious programs and seeing what’s inside.|

## **- Miscellaneous**
The books found here are not really categorized and can be everything under the IT umbrella.

| Book | Description |
| ---- | ----------- |
| **RTFM (RED TEAM FIELD MANUAL)**  | Just like the name suggests, this book is for red teams who occasionally find themselves scanning through man pages | **APPRENDRE 3.0** | a book by the inventor of the pedagogy of Epita, Epitech, school 42 and zone 01
